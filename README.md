# PlotR
*Useful R scripts for various graphs and analyses.*

## Scripts
* **MAF_Plot.R:** Given Plink .frq files, plots MAFs for SNPs found in both datasets.
* **MAF_Filter.R:** Given Plink .frq files, return SNPs whose MAFs differ between datasets by less than 'difference'.
* **plotSNPIntensity.r:** Given at least one SNP (as 'CHR:BP') as well as XY intensity and GT data, return SNP intensity plots.

## Work in progress
* **plotAssocSelection.r**: Given association & selection results, plot these overlaid at a given locus.
